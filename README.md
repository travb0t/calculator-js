# calculator-js

This is a project is intended to refresh my javascript knowledge and hopefully learn a little bit more by building a simple calculator to start and a more complicated calculator by the end of the project.

<!-- Done:

- Task 1 -->

Current tasks:

- build a js function to create the calculator itself.
    - body / output screen / input buttons

- add basic styling to the produced calculator

<!-- Future To Do:

- Task 3
    - Sub Task -->
